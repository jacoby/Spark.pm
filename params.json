Second choice is to put it in your ~/lib directory, and add use lib '/home/you/lib' before including it.\r\n\r\nHere's my minimal spark.pl program.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/perl\r\n\r\nuse 5.010 ; # so I can use 'say'\r\nuse strict ;\r\nuse warnings ;\r\nuse utf8 ; # the sparks are unicode\r\nuse lib '/home/jacoby/lib' ;\r\nuse Spark ;\r\n\r\nsay spark @ARGV ;\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
